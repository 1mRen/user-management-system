## Introduction

The **User Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline user authentication, authorization, and account management. It provides a secure and efficient way to handle user registration, authentication, and role-based access control. 

Built with **Node.js** and **MySQL** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend, this system ensures a seamless experience for both users and administrators. Key features include JWT authentication, email verification, password recovery, profile management, and an admin dashboard for managing user accounts. Additionally, a fake backend implementation is available to facilitate development and testing without requiring a live backend.

## Backend Setup (Node.js + MySQL)

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/user-management-system.git
   cd user-management-system/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install 
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` folder and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
